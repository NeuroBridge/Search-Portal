### 🚧 Development

You'll need Node v14.16.0 or higher. If you don't have that version installed, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to specify a Node version with `nvm use 14.16.0`. Install dependencies with `npm ci`. Run development server on port 8080 with `npm start`.

### 🎁 Production

Build the application for production with `npm run build`. The `dist` directory will contain the bundled files.
